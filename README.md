# SRNSW Index Harvester

Here you'll find code to harvest data from the indexes published online by State Records NSW and save them as CSV files.

I've pre-harvested all the current indexes for your convenience. You can browse them below, or poke around in the `data` directory. You can also download a [zip file](https://github.com/wragge/srnsw-indexes/archive/master.zip) (about 54mb) containing the complete repository.

The repository includes two versions of each index. The web layout of the indexes on the State Archives site includes a number of empty columns. I've harvested and saved these as they are, but I have also created a 'cleaned' version with the unnecessary columns removed. Both versions are provided so you can check that nothing important has been lost in the cleaning process.

One index, the 'Early Convict Index', is linked on the State Archives site to an [old version](http://indexes.records.nsw.gov.au/searchform.aspx?id=77), however, a [new version](https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/searchhits_nocopy?id=77&surname=%25&firstname=&alias=&tried_at=0&county=0&tried%20when=0&sentence=0&ship=0&ship%20page=&remarks=) exists and this is the version I've harvested. Strangely, my harvest results in more rows than seem to be present on the site. I'm not sure why this is.

There are more [details about the available indexes](https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/indexes-a-z) on the SRNSW site.

Thanks to the SRNSW staff and volunteers for preparing all this most excellent data.

## Create your own harvest

You'll need to have [Robobrowser](https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser) installed.

To create a list of all the available indexes and their urls, do:


``` python

import indexes
indexes.list_indexes()

```

This generates a [CSV file](data/indexes.csv) listing the index name and url.

To harvest all the indexes you can do:

``` python

import indexes
indexes.get_all_indexes()
```

To harvest an individual index, find the one you want in the [indexes.csv](data/indexes.csv) file and copy the row. The you can do:

``` python
import harvest
harvest.get_index([paste the row in here])
```
